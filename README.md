Book reader app

## Getting Started

Whole solution consists of Bookreader web app, Bookreader landing app, 
epub reader library and mobile application, that use this lib.

üòê You can see code duplication and hard for reading code, 
   cause I worked on multiple projects and didn't have enough time for writing good code.

Flavors:
PROD:
--flavor=prod
prod
main.dart

DEV
--flavor=dev
--flavor=prod
dev
main_dev.dart

Run app on prod, cause in dev environment LCP library doesn't work, cause we don't 
want to waste money and time on setup dev environment on Amazon for running LCP lib for dev purposes

for the composing release apk:
fvm flutter build apk --flavor prod -t lib/main.dart
